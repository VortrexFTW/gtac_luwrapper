# LU Wrapper for GTA Connected
This resource adds the ability to use LU scripts on GTA Connected.

**This resource is unfinished!**
This resource is still under heavy development, and is still in early stages.

In order to be compatible with GTA Connected, some features of LU need to be manually scripted. This resource will include:
- Nametags
- Spawn screen
- Trains
- Probably some other shit I'm forgetting.
